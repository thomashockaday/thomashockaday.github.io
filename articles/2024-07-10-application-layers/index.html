            <p>
              In programming, we think a lot about separation of concerns. We
              want our code to do a lot of exciting things, but we need to be
              able to read and maintain it. In object-oriented programming, a
              common way to achieve this is to give each "object" one thing to
              control. This is commonly called the
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener"
                >single-responsibility principle</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a file/object in our code does one thing, it becomes much
              easier to read, to edit, and to
              <a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/unit-testing/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener"
                >unit test</a
              >. With this in mind we need to figure out how to fit these
              objects together so we can see the system working from end to end.
              Welcome to systems design.

            <h2>Making a car</h2>

            <p>
              Imagine you work on the production line of a car factory. You push
              the lit button in front of you. The light goes out and an empty
              chassis rolls up to the first machine. The first machine adds
              wheels to the frame and passes it to the second machine. The
              second machine adds the engine and passes it to the third machine.
              The third machine adds the body and sends the finished car to the
              end of the line, at which point the button lights up, letting you
              know you can press it again.
            </p>

            <p>There are three things we can learn from this example:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>I clearly do not work in a car factory</li>
              <li>
                For an object inside a system to do something impactful, it
                usually needs input and output. The machines take the car as an
                input, adjust it somehow, and output the adjusted form.
              </li>
              <li>
                The order of the objects is consistent and must be preserved; we
                cannot add the wheels if we do not have the chassis first.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              If the order of the objects is enforced as consistent, object 1
              becomes a wrapper around object 2, stopping anything else from
              accessing it directly.
            </p>

            <p>
              Having one consistent way in and out of a system is not unusual
              and is an excellent way to ensure system security. Consider the
              imaginary factory again. How did you arrive? Did you use the
              designated entrance? Did you pass through the metal detector? Did
              you scan your badge to enter the production floor? If we find
              alternative entrances that do not revolve around these
              checkpoints, what risks do we open ourselves up to?
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, consider the utility of each of these processes based on
              the end goal of building cars. If the factory suddenly started
              making trains instead, would the entrance and security checks
              remain the same? As important as all these protective outer layers
              are to the survival of the business, if you want to make anything
              unique happen, you must be in the middle.
            </p>

              class="article-image shadow"
              alt="An applications layers get more domain-specific as they move into the middle"
              loading="lazy"
            />

            <p>
              The inner layers handle any final state of change. The outer
              layers enable the inner layers to do their jobs safely. The outer
              layers handle business logic, and the inner layers handle domain
              logic. While the inner layers cannot control the outer layers,
              they can optionally communicate a change in state. The final
              machine on the production floor is the only thing that truly knows
              whether it is okay for you to push your button again or not, so it
              must be able to communicate this.

            <h2>Onion architecture</h2>

            <p>
              Jeffrey Palermo described these nested layers as
              <a
                href="https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener"
                >onion architecture</a
              >
              in 2008. This term is now used quite heavily in the industry, and
              one I have been asked to define several times in interviews.
              Researching online shows some variation in what makes up our onion
              and what those layers should be, but some aspects of it will
              always be true.
            </p>

            <p>
              The onion represents the main application code. The external data
              stores, deployed infrastructure and third-party dependencies
              cannot be the ultimate decider of our application function. A
              layer of our application may consume some of these things, but
              they must do it in a way that is steadfast to change. This is
              achieved through interfaces and abstractions. If we changed our
              database engine from MySQL to SQLite tomorrow, then we should only
              need to change the code in one of our layers at most.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our objects/layers should be easy to build. Patterns such as
              <a
                href="https://stackify.com/dependency-injection/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener"
                >dependency injection</a
              >
              should be used to make sure our interfaces point at the correct
              implementations. The outermost layer of most onion codebases is a
              bootstrapping layer, where no domain logic is stored and where the
              dependencies, config and interfaces are wired together.

              Let's push that button again and see where our layer separations
              lie.

              We move deeper into the application whenever the system needs to
              ask a question about its readiness to complete the specified
              function.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                The first layer performs basic validation on the input to
                determine whether or not to process the request.
              </li>

              <li>
                The second layer prepares all of the machines with the necessary
                parts to make the car.
              </li>

              <li>
                The third and final layer lets each machine on the line do its
                job. This process could be broken down into its own layers if
                needed.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The outcome of the process is the released car. The output of the
              system provides this information to the user.
            </p>

            <p>
              In reality each of these layers would also ask whether or not
              there was a system error and allow that to bubble back up to the
              outer layers to feed this information back to the user.
            </p>

            <p>
              One thing I love about this pattern is the way it creates clear
              boundaries between testing types. An object or layer can be unit
              tested in total isolation. Layers can be built and combined
              downwards into integration tests. The entire system function can
              be tested end to end.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can scale this model up and down indefinitely. How does your
              arrival to the factory fit into this? Could each machine on the
              line have its own diagram and layers? Absolutely. If we decided to
              add a second input to the system, validation could become its own
              layer.

              between the layers, while the onion uses dependency inversion to
              ensure each layer is much more separated from its surroundings.
              This is similar to how hexagonal architecture allows each hexagon
              to exist and function independently, and the architecture focuses
              on how they slot together.

              Understanding the difference is much easier when focusing solely
              on your code and not the dependencies, data stores and deployed
              infrastructure. Ultimately, being able to separate your desired
              outcome into specific processes, deciding whether each process is
              a business process or a domain process, and then finding a
              structured way to slot those processes together will make your
              code more testable and maintainable, and probably help you
              understand your desired outcome a bit better, too.
