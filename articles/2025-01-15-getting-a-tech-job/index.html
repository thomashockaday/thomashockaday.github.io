              recently published by the brilliant Theo Browne. In October 2024,
              7 years into my software engineering career, I was affected by a
              wave of tech layoffs for the first time. Through some grit and
              good fortune, I was able to find a new role at a really great
              place after around 2 months. I want to expand on the original
              video a little bit with my own job application experiences here in
              the UK. If you haven't already seen the original video, I totally
              recommend it.

            <h2>Hiring junior engineers</h2>

            <p>
              The first lead engineer I worked with used to talk about
              "mouldability". He said he would rather hire a team of good people
              with no experience and train them to do the job than hire
              experienced developers who were stuck in their ways and had little
              ambition. As a junior I only saw the positive side of this. I had
              landed my first job as a web developer after completely blagging
              my way through the interview, and grew rapidly over the first few
              years in an environment where it felt safe to make small mistakes.
            </p>

            <p>
              With the benefit of hindsight I'm now able to see the other side
              of this statement. Devs joining the team who had come from more
              senior roles elsewhere often felt their opinions went unheard and
              didn't stay too long. People who'd been there for a couple years
              felt they had outgrown their role as there was little progression
              available. There were definitely some cases of culture clash, but
              as much as I loved my job there as a junior, I still believe to
              this day that I had to move on in order to grow any further than I
              already had. This is probably going to be the case for all but the
              largest companies who have solid career frameworks in place.
            </p>

            <p>
              Theo makes a comparison between prompting
              <a

                >Claude</a
              >
              and mentoring junior engineers. Going forward new tech businesses
              who want to move fast and push boundaries may leverage AI in this
              way and almost replace the role of the junior developer. There are
              already some
              <a
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener"

                >extremely talented devs who are struggling to land their first
                role</a
              >
              in the industry. There's certainly nothing more mouldable than a
              large language model, but there will always be room for a human
              who cares about tech and who cares about the product they're
              building.
            </p>

            <p>
              Companies hiring junior developers do so because they have the
              time and resources to make that investment. They likely have a
              fairly stable product already and need to maintain their core
              business offerings while starting to explore new ground. Ambitious
              junior developers make excellent assets to these teams. They can
              be shown how to contribute to the existing business tech, and have
              the opportunity to go into new tech/product discussions on a level
              playing field with their more seasoned co-workers. By the time the
              new MVP is ready the junior will have grown into twice the
              developer they were when they started, and will be ready to take
              on more responsibility. The investment pays off on all sides.

            <h2>Money, growth and passion</h2>

            <p>
              Sure, there are are juniors without a burning ambition. This is
              true for all levels. If anything it's more common the more you
              climb the corporate ladder. Over the years I've been quite
              resilient against burnout, but one of my biggest challenges after
              being laid off from a job I loved and poured everything into for
              over 4 years was finding the motivation to move on. I'm not
              embarassed to say some of the places I applied to I did so because
              I needed "a job". Thankfully, I did end up finding a place I
              really cared about and felt welcome.
            </p>

            <p>
              I've worked with plenty of people who've seen their tech job as
              that, a job. They do their 9-5 and complete every task they're
              asked to complete but never push further. As a junior beneath
              these people it can be quite frustrating, but they're usually good
              people with an excellent work-life balance. I've also worked with
              bosses who will contradict themselves by saying "You need the
              passion to code for 13 hours a day if you want to grow" but then
              also saying "You need a work-life balance". Can you have both?
            </p>

            <p>
              Regardless, in 3 years you will have surpassed the people you're
              working harder than, but most importantly you will also have
              surpassed yourself. The thing about applying for a junior engineer
              role is, you're probably only going to have to do it once.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm from the generation that got into coding because it was fun,
              and it's important to me that I still spend time outside of
              working hours keeping it fun. I watch tech YouTube videos
              (obviously) and build
              <a
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener"
                href="https://thomashockaday.github.io/kill-the-parrot/"
                >goofy little experiments</a
              >. I see no reason not to think this mindset has helped my career
              over the years, and naturally, money often comes with that.
            </p>

            <p>
              There will always be people who get into tech because of the
              money, and this is often painted in a negative light. While I
              didn't do so myself, I can also say without a doubt one of the
              best and most abitious lead engineers I ever worked with has
              always been very open about the fact he was drawn to tech because
              of the money. As much as it pains me to admit, I included money
              for the first time as one of the factors to consider in my most
              recent job search. The reality is that 7 years ago I didn't have a
              car, or a mortgage. If I also factor in marriage and young
              children, I can sympathise with his reasoning a bit more now than
              I could then. If nothing else, I've seen proof that getting into
              tech for money doesn't have to mean you won't be a passionate
              engineer who's hungry to grow and deliver value.
            </p>

            <p>
              It's easy for a manager to see low output in team members as a
              product of low ambition, but from my experience the instances of
              this being true are few and far between. Those who have settled
              for that easier lifestyle will end up being tasked with some of
              the more monotonous tasks that might not be the best use of the
              senior's time. If the company budget allows for it, they will be
              kept around. Unfortunately for seniors, this paints a much larger
              target on them.

            <h2>Layoffs</h2>

            <p>
              Layoffs, usually called redundancies here in the UK, are common in
              tech.
              <a
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener"
                href="https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/2024/the-10-biggest-tech-company-layoffs-of-2024"
                >Big tech in the US goes through waves of hiring and firing in
                the thousands</a
              >, but generally speaking the UK is quite resilient to this. Even
              during COVID, I only ever met one engineer who'd been laid off and
              had to find work elsewhere. In fact, my own redundancy experience
              was through a once-English company who'd been bought out by an
              American firm a couple years ago. Call it coincidence if you will.
            </p>

            <p>
              For those looking for a new dev job, this means you have a massive
              pool of people to compete with. Especially now that a lot of
              companies are willing to hire remote to find the best talent. Once
              you reach a level in your career, you're very unlikely to
              willingly step down from it due to the salary implications. You
              can probably avoid this by moving to a bigger company, but the
              interview process for a lead/staff role in a small company is very
              similar to the process for a senior role in a larger company. Both
              are designed to test and reward you, and both will attract a lot
              of applicants because of that.
            </p>

            <p>
              For people aspiring to move into more senior roles for the first
              time, the ambition you've carried in your career so far - as well
              as the fact you're probably going to have a lower salary
              expectation than someone moving between senior roles - will work
              to your advantage here. This depends, unfortunately, on you being
              able to land a face-to-face interview in the first place; which is
              proving to be more challenging than ever before.

            <h2>The role of AI</h2>

            <p>
              AI is everywhere, whether we like it or not. If you're working for
              a startup right now, you're probably being asked by an executive
              to shove AI into their product somehow. You probably know someone
              using an AI code-completion tool in their daily workflow. If
              you're looking for another job, you're probably using AI to write
              your CV/résumé, and
              <a

                >you're probably having it be reviewed and processed by AI</a
              >, too.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm one of the few old farts that has yet to adopt AI into most of
              the things I do. Sure, I've used ChatGPT a few times with mildly
              successful results. The cover image for this article is the first
              image I've ever generated with AI that I've then actually found a
              use for, but in terms of how I navigate AI I'm comparable to that
              old man in the pub that thinks Facebook, Google, and "the
              internet" are all the same thing. It never crossed my mind to
              leverage AI during my job application process until I realised it
              was being used against me anyway.

              Most of the jobs I applied for in the early days simply went
              unanswered. According to the sites I was using they all had
              hundreds of applicants within mere days of being posted. My first
              rejection came exactly 10 days after applying, with a generic
              message from an email address seemingly belonging to a woman who
              worked at the company but wasn't mentioned on the original
              application or the company website. The email said I hadn't made
              the cut this time. I replied thanking them for actually responding
              to my application and asking if they could provide any further
              feedback - eager to know if something in my CV had come across the
              wrong way or if I was missing a particular skill. Unfortunately, I
              never heard back.
            </p>

            <p>
              A few weeks later, also exactly 10 days after applying, I received
              an eerily similar email from a different company. By this point
              during the job search I was feeling pretty burned out, so replied
              with a simple "Thank you for getting back to me. Have a good day."
              To my surprise, I received a thorough reply a few seconds later,
              expanding on the fact I had been rejected - without clarifying the
              reason - and wishing me well for the future. There is no a way a
              human could have written this reply in this time. For me, this
              felt worse than failing any tech test or awful interview.
            </p>

              subreddit which was an absolute gold mine of wisdom. When I shared
              my CV publicly on LinkedIn and with some ex-colleagues a few very
              kind people were willing to offer advice on some points that
              needed clarifying. A few also pointed out I could just get AI to
              write it for me. I didn't want to use AI on my CV or covering
              letters, because I wanted them to represent me, warts and all.
              Something about it just didn't feel right.
            </p>

            <p>
              Eventually I had tweaked my CV enough so that even after days of
              staring at it I couldn't think of any more changes. At that point
              I finally scratched the itch and fed it into ChatGPT. I asked it
              to rewrite the content to be more concise, professional, and help
              pass ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems). What I received back was
              something that felt extremely similar with no real reason behind a
              lot of the wording changes. Two of the points under one section
              had been combined into one and there were some shortened
              sentences, but for the most part everything seemed pretty much the
              same. It just felt less like me. Some of the points also now
              started with words that the EngineeringResumes wiki had
              specifically said to avoid. After sitting on the proposed changes
              for a few days I ended up taking the ones I liked - generally the
              ones that removed words from points without removing meaning - and
              leaving the ones I didn't. The result was a marginal improvement.
              I felt happy that I was able to create something that could only
              be refined to such a limited extent, but you could also argue I
              could have saved myself a dozen hours by just doing that in the
              first place.

            <h2>Technical assessments</h2>

            <p>
              Interestingly, I encountered some very different viewpoints on AI
              (and tooling in general) while doing tech tests for companies.
              Nobody likes tech tests, especially not the person issuing them,
              but ultimately it's a common way for companies to try and ensure
              they're getting what they pay for. Thankfully I didn't need to
              write down any algorithms on a whiteboard, but a lot of what I did
              experience also showed me as a candidate what kind of place I was
              interviewing for.
            </p>

            <p>
              During a first round conversation with one company, I was asked
              about my competence in 7 different languages and frameworks. I
              told them with all honesty I was pretty confident in 6 of the 7,
              but the final one was something I had virtually no experience in
              and would have to spend a few weeks learning in order to really
              fill the role. They said this was absolutely fine. That night I
              was sent a link to an unsupervised but recorded online assessment
              with very clear, strict rules. I had to have my camera on and
              share my screen for the duration of the test, and during the test
              I was not allowed to navigate away from the main test page - i.e.
              to use a search engine or AI assistant. The questions were
              generally asking about quirks of each technology or given a
              snippet of code and a problem to solve, fix the code. All things
              an AI would have been exceptional at answering I'm sure.
              Unfortunately for me most of the questions were very specific to
              the one language I had confessed to having no competence in, so I
              spent the hour sweating my way through each question; trying and
              failing to run the code given each time until I got somewhere near
              a solution. After the first few questions I realised I was
              fighting a losing battle and started skipping the ones I knew I'd
              never get. I am by no means the best developer out there, but I
              think a lot of people would have struggled with this assessment
              given that there was no way to access any kind of documentation as
              you worked. Quite frankly the whole thing felt a bit unfair, but I
              suppose I would say that considering how terribly I performed. To
              my absolute shock at the end of the test, I was notified that I
              had performed in the top 36% of candidates and someone would "be
              in touch". Naturally, I never heard from this company again. When
              describing this experience to some of my former co-workers, more
              than one of them said they would have left the room and returned
              when the timer hit zero, simply refusing to comply with a test of
              this nature.
            </p>

            <p>
              Not too long after this, I attended my only in-person technical
              assessment where I was questioned for half an hour then given a
              React Native project to work on. The project environment was
              relaxed, but it was still an assessment. While trying to kick my
              brain back into gear after the questioning, I forgot a fairly
              simple piece of syntax I needed and asked if I could Google it
              quickly. The interviewer seemed quite surprised by the question
              and said "Absolutely. Use whatever you need, I just want to see
              how you work." Needless to say this was one of the better
              experiences I had, by far.
            </p>

            <p>
              The only truly unsupervised assessment I did was for a finance
              company who had sent a problem which was half maths, half coding.
              Instructions were loose and I had a whole week to play about with
              a solution. I quite liked this approach. It suggested I could have
              used AI or any tooling to help write the solution and even unit
              test it, but the problem itself was complex enough that I would
              have needed some pretty specific prompts in order to get an
              accurate working implementation.
            </p>

            <p>
              The final assessment of note was a pairing exercise with a lead
              engineer. He had prepared a small Laravel project with clear
              instructions about where he wanted to take it. My job was to
              follow those instructions under his watch, talking through each.
              After some light back and forth we managed to complete every
              requirement. Towards the end of the interview when it became clear
              there would be another round and I was feeling more relaxed, I
              asked how he would have felt if I had brought up an AI assistant
              to go through the task with me. He said quite nonchalantly that if
              I wanted to work that way I was more than welcome, as the
              important thing was explaining the process, navigating the
              architecture, and ultimately understanding the problem. Again,
              this was a positive experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              While I didn't end up taking offers at any of these companies, I
              sincerely hope companies 2, 3 and 4 have found exactly what they
              need in their ideal candidate, and I hope company 1 has found a
              new way to test people, or launched their own dev trivia-oriented
              game show. I'd watch it.

            <h2>The importance of networking</h2>

            <p>
              Not only is building relationships important, it's something
              you're going to do whether you're trying or not, so you might as
              well build good ones.
            </p>

            <p>
              I got my first ever dev job interview through the recommendation
              of a great friend who later became a colleague. I got my second
              job interview through the recommendation of a colleague who later
              became a great friend. I still had to do the interviews and tech
              tests, but having those connections is an incredible advantage. If
              nothing else it gets your CV a bit closer to the top of the pile.
            </p>

            <p>
              "Back in the day" I was encouraged to go to local tech and
              business meetups and conferences. Many companies will make time
              for their devs to go to conferences if you can show there's
              something there that will make you better at your job. A lot of
              this depends on your patience and your ability to socialise.
              You're not going to get offers thrown at you just by attending a
              meetup, although you might get a great slice of pizza.
            </p>

            <p>
              For introverts, you can expand your network without leaving your
              room. Most conferences stream their talks. The worlds largest
              platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Twitch, Discord, Reddit and
              LinkedIn are full of amazing tech creators and people eager to
              join discussions in the comments. Websites like
              <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dev.to">dev.to</a>
              let you explore the more social side of tech. Popular open source
              projects often have thousands of issues and discussions on GitHub.
            </p>

            <p>
              While I don't have a Twitch or a Discord myself, I can't see a
              negative side to joining such a community if I really wanted to
              boost my career prospects. Theo got so many comments for plugging
              his own communities that he had to address them in
              <a
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener"
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PiM2e4RtTg&lc=UgzXX8aNHh4x3GUIyVB4AaABAg"
                >his own comment</a
              >, which seems a little unfair. That being said, there are
              hundreds of communities out there, and you should find ones that
              suit you, your interests, and your humour - because there's a lot
              of crap out there too.
            </p>

            <p>
              The one massive advantage joining communities will bring you is
              being able to have a conversation about tech. Interviews don't
              have to be an intense round of questions and answers, they can be
              conversations. If you can talk comfortably about your interests
              and experiences you're going to have a great interview. You might
              even enjoy it. This communication skill will only benefit you when
              aiming for more senior roles, as you'll be able to outline project
              technical requirements clearly and effectively mentor and pair
              with your colleagues.

            <h2>A note on recruiters</h2>

            <p>
              The UK tech market is saturated with recruitment companies who
              essentially act as middlemen between you and your prospective
              employer. Their job is to find you, find jobs that match your
              skills, and help you prepare for the interview processes. In
              return they receive a commission from the employer when a new
              candidate is successfully hired.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are some recruiters out there who will try to shove you in
              every role they find so they can get their commission. There are
              some who will ghost you completely if you're not having much
              success or not including specific keywords on your CV. I got so
              many messages from recruiters who didn't want to put me forward
              for roles because I didn't have Node.js listed as a skill on my CV
              despite the fact I really didn't see a reason to include it or see
              it as different enough from vanilla JavaScript to even make that
              distinction. Of course, a wiser man may have just shut up and
              listed it.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are also recruiters who will spend hours on the phone
              telling you more than you could possibly even need to know about
              your potential new employer, new manager, and new role. There are
              good people who will wish you the best of luck even if you decide
              not to go with their agency in the end. Good luck finding them,
              because it's becoming increasingly hard to avoid using recruiters
              altogether.
            </p>

            <p>
              I've met a few really solid devs who landed their first roles
              straight out of university or bootcamps due to recruitment
              agencies attending career days or sponsoring those bootcamps. All
              of the experiences I mentioned above were found through
              recruiters. They can be a real asset; helping negotiate salaries
              and providing basic contact info that may otherwise be hard to
              find (like an office address). If networking is important, which
              it should be, then recruiters are your cheat code.

            <h2>Parting thoughts</h2>

            <p>
              In one of my previous roles I used to hold second stage interviews
              for back end engineering applicants. I saw a lot of CVs and a lot
              of different types of people. I'm proud to say I never gave anyone
              a pass that didn't then go on to become an absolute asset to the
              company.
            </p>

            <p>
              Every interviewer is going to have a different set of criteria. My
              own were very simple and I carried them through to my own job
              interviews which mostly went pretty well. If I could sum them up I
              would say: be honest, be yourself, have a conversation, be
              respectful, celebrate your team, and find something about the
              company that makes you want to work there. Or, as Theo succintly
              ended his video:
